## What is GoPro Connect (Webcam mode)?

Simply put, it exposes the same APIs available when using the camera via WiFi but over USB Ethernet.

## Commands:

Start recording/taking a photo works (see: https://twitter.com/konrad_it/status/1309092303651434498)

**NOTE**: Issue these commands over IP ending on the *.51* octet.

- Webcam mode START: http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpWebcam/START
	- Resolutions:
	- 1080p: http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpWebcam/START?res=1080
	- 720p: http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpWebcam/START?res=720
	- 480p: http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpWebcam/START?res=480
- Webcam mode STOP: http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpWebcam/STOP
- Wide FOV: http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpWebcam/SETTINGS?fov=0
- Linear FOV: http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpWebcam/SETTINGS?fov=4
- Narrow FOV: http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpWebcam/SETTINGS?fov=6

### For Wifi

**NOTE**: The UDP streaming is directed to the IP who sent the API by HTTP GET, instead of broadcasting. And you need to constantly GET (every 25s or so) to keep the streaming alive.

- Webcam mode START: http://10.5.5.9/gp/gpControl/execute?p1=gpStream&c1=start
- Webcam mode STOP: http://10.5.5.9/gp/gpControl/execute?p1=gpStream&c1=stop
- Webcam mode RESTART: http://10.5.5.9/gp/gpControl/execute?p1=gpStream&c1=restart

## Media browsing:

JSON media list exposed under http://172.XX.XXX.51/gp/gpMediaList 

Thumbail endpoint works as well.

## Live preview

After Webcam mode START, a live stream will be started and streamed out on UDP port 8554.


VLC command: ```vlc -vvv --network-caching=300 --sout-x264-preset=ultrafast --sout-x264-tune=zerolatency --sout-x264-vbv-bufsize 0 --sout-transcode-threads 4 --no-audio udp://@:8554```

Many thanks to Daryl Stimm from GoPro for making most of the info here public.
